## LZ4 for iOS and Mac OS X (Intel & Apple Silicon M1) - arm64 / x86_64

Supported version: 1.9.4

This repo provides a universal script for building static liblzma library for use in iOS and Mac OS X applications.
The actual library version is taken from https://github.com/lz4/lz4 with tag 'v1.9.4'


## Prerequisites
  1) Xcode must be installed because xcodebuild is used to create xcframeworks
  2) ```xcode-select -p``` must point to Xcode app developer directory (by default e.g. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer). If it points to CommandLineTools directory you should execute:
  ```sudo xcode-select --reset``` or ```sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer```
  3) CMake (at least version 3.13) must be installed (e.g. by brew install cmake) 

## How to build?
 - Manually
```
    # clone the repo
    git clone -b 1.9.4 https://github.com/apotocki/lz4-iosx
    
    # build libraries
    cd lz4-iosx
    scripts/build.sh

    # have fun, the result artifacts will be located in 'frameworks' folder.
```    
 - Use cocoapods. Add the following lines into your project's Podfile:
```
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'lz4-iosx', '~> 1.9.4'
    # or optionally more precisely
    # pod 'lz4-iosx', :git => 'https://github.com/apotocki/lz4-iosx', :tag => '1.9.4.0'
```    
install new dependency:
```
   pod install --verbose
```

## As an advertisement…
The LZ4 XCFramework built by this project is used in my iOS application on the App Store:
